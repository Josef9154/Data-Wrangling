# Data-Wrangling
This project consists of pulling Video Game data from a flat file, Web Scrapping of Wikipedia, Twitter APIs, and Rapid API Json collection of data.
I use SQLite as an example but followed through mostly with MySQL, which includes adding a game schema and SQLalchemy as an engine to visualize the data
